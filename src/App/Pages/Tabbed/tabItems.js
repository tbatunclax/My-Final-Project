        text: '<p>In 1938 DC published the first Superman story in Action Comics no. 1. The massive commercial success of that character was responsible for creating the costumed superhero genre, which has been a mainstay for the comic book industry ever since. DC introduced many superheroes throughout the so-called Golden Age of comics, most notably Batman (1939) and Wonder Woman (1941).</p><p> The success of those characters was amplified by Licensing Corporation of America, a division of National Periodicals. Licensing Corporation of America, which was created as Superman Inc., marketed DC’s various characters through a wide range of products, and it oversaw the use of DC characters in other media.</p>',

        title: 'Marvel',
        text: '<p>Though the concept of a shared universe was not new or unique to comic books in 1961, writer/editor Stan Lee, together with several artists including Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, created a series of titles where events in one book would have repercussions in another title and serialized stories would show characters\' growth and change. Headline characters in one title would make cameos or guest appearances in other books. Eventually, many of the leading heroes assembled into a team known as the Avengers. </p><p>This was not the first time that Marvel\'s characters had interacted with one another—Namor the Sub-Mariner and the original Human Torch had been rivals when Marvel was Timely Comics (Marvel Vault)— but it was the first time that the comic book publisher\'s characters seemed to share a world. </p><p>The Marvel Universe was also notable for setting its central titles in New York City; by contrast, many DC heroes live in fictional cities. Care was taken to portray the city and the world as realistically as possible, with the presence of superhumans affecting the common citizens in various ways.</p>',
